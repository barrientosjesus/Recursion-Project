# TOP Recursion-Project

<h3>Assignment 1</h3>
1. Write a method #fibs which takes a number and returns that many members of the fibonacci sequence. Use iteration for this solution.
2. Now write another method #fibs_rec which solves the same problem recursively. This can be done in just 3 lines (or 1 if you’re crazy, but don’t consider either of these lengths a requirement… just get it done).

<h3>Assignment 2</h3>
1. Build a method #merge_sort that takes in an array and returns a sorted array, using a recursive merge sort methodology.
